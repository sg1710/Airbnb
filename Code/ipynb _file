🏠 Airbnb Business Growth Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data to predict which properties are most likely to experience business growth. By identifying factors that influence success, the project aims to provide valuable insights for Airbnb hosts, investors, and analysts.

The analysis is performed in Python using data science and machine learning techniques, with an emphasis on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

🎯 Objective

Main Goal: Determine which Airbnb listings are likely to grow in business based on historical and listing-related data.

Why?

Help hosts optimize pricing, amenities, and marketing.

Assist investors in selecting high-potential properties.

Provide data-driven insights into the short-term rental market.
